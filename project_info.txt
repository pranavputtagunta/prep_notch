Shared document access: 
    For large documents, summarize them and organize them with json files that provide the structure and summaries of each document
    Pass these jsons to agents when they need additional information so they know what documents to access. 

Lesson Planning structure: 
    Once the goals are made by the goal planner, pass them to a lesson planner
    The lesson planner will make one overarching lesson plan - both the goal and lesson planner are run Once
    The scheduler will then make a schedule based on the user's time commitment and deadline
        Will take info from the goal and lesson planners
    Finally, another agent will chunk up the overarching lesson according to the scheduler
    This workflow allows for easy changes to the schedule while not having to regenerate lessons.
