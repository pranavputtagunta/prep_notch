**Dependencies, Skills, and Other Notes:**

*   **Dependencies:** Each task generally depends on the completion of the previous one, but there can be overlap (e.g., start practice questions while still doing content review).
*   **Required Skills:** Knowledge of basic medical sciences, critical thinking, test-taking skills.
*   **Resources:** Identify and gather necessary study materials (textbooks, online resources, practice question banks).
*   **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adjust the plan based on your progress and performance.
